      <p>
        Starting my work in 2016, with my first Bachata remix of Ariana Grande's, "Into You". I started my journey as a mashup / remix creator known as "starlightmusic". I left that name after two years and renamed my brand as "Dangerous Symphony" where I released two remixed albums,"restarted: reloaded" & "Prohibited Desires". After the releases of continues projects, I took a break from remix and music to focus on graduting from high school and college. But 2020 came around, and I was stuck at home once again, so I found myself remixing again and from there I came back as myself, Eduardo Crispin Music, where I have started to blow up in the remix / mashup community! With my biggest video hitting over 15,000 VIEWS! As of now, I run my newest channel platform, "comfortress" on YouTube. <strong>Check it out now!</strong>

  <h1>Latest Project: Love Story & Boys Like You - Taylor Swift, ITZY (ft. BLACKPINK) </h1>

   The latest project featured on comfortress project, a full mashup featuring Taylor Swift's, Love Story and ITZY's, Boys Like You, while remixing a sample rap from BLACKPINK's, Lovesick Girls. Matching the BPM, vocal stems, and instrumentation, building this mashup together was very detailed, from editing the audio itself to the video editing process. making sure each cut is clean and makes sense, trying to coralate each scene with each other despite the difference in both videos. Not to mention the year gap of releases from both songs. Being able to create such projects enhance music and show a bit of what the creator loves to make and the talent behind the ongoing music!

      Behance is platform to showcase art and designs, I took this chance to be able to show my art and projects. I've used the same set of skills to also help me create the thumbnail art / visualizer art you might see throughout my YouTube content. I had started doing design projects throughout high school, but never had a proper and steady platform to showcase my work, until now with Behance. You can find me "@xioeddie" and check out the few concept designs I have released.
